# CS-300
Throughout this course, I worked on two key projects that deepened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of different data structures, which helped me understand how the choice of data structure impacts the efficiency and scalability of a program. In Project Two, I developed a program that sorts and prints a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order. This required applying sorting algorithms and choosing the right data structures to store and manipulate the course data efficiently. These projects challenged me to think critically about performance and reinforced the importance of choosing the right tools for the job.

As I worked through the projects, I encountered roadblocks such as deciding between competing data structures and debugging unexpected sorting behavior. I overcame these challenges by researching, reviewing documentation, and experimenting with different approaches. These experiences improved my problem-solving skills and changed the way I approach software design. I now put greater emphasis on writing code that is not only functional, but also maintainable and adaptable. Iâ€™ve learned to structure my code more clearly, use meaningful variable names, and keep the logic modular for easier future updates. These lessons will continue to guide me as I take on more complex programming challenges in the future.
